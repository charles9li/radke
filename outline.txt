Abstract

Intro
- importance of surface charge
	- how things interact in solution
	- everything carries a charge (biology, materials)
- zeta potentials
- ion exchange
- surface force
- describe mica
- different ways of thinking of mica (Wikipedia)
	- ppl haven't combined all 3 types of measurements
	- pashley, israelachvili have tried to measure these quantities, haven't translated across data sets
- possibly soudek?

Theory
- triple-layer model
	- inkscape figure
	- partially-hyd, fully-hyd
	- eqns, etc
		- PB
	- capacitances
		- from radii
- zeta
- ion exch
	- how we integrate through diffuse layer
- surface force
	- BCs
	- how we get force from osmotic pressure
- numerical implementation
	- solved these eqns using this func

Results and Discussion
- discuss where charge is
	- different K values
	- alkali vs H+
- get figures
- dilute solution theory breaks down
- mention K values, etc that validate model
	- sensitity to K values
		- inserts

Appendix
- how to convert osman data

To do
- find other ion exchange data
- fix spikes with code
- do theory and results section first




Notes 3/27
- start with SFA work about DLVO
- they adjust kappa and surface potential
- charge found is much smaller than number of surface sites
- deficiences in model
- refer to previous work (pashley and healy)
	- take an acid base instead of exchange
- results
	- how to get parameters from zeta potentials and ion exchange
	- works for low ionic strength
- unified theory is needed
- put equations in appendices




Figures
- ticks on both sides (outside is fine)
- seaborn
- don't put box around legend
- can save figures as svg files
- width
	- for 2 col, 2.5 in wide
	- for 1 col, 6.5 col
- have plot of sigma_d, sigma_beta, e*SM vs K
- have data and figure in separate file


Formatting
- 14pt font for clay
